#A simple Node.JS, Express, and Mongo template for OpenShift
This is a simple Node.JS template that uses Express and has mongodb set up. It is all wired to go in OpenShift. I would not recommend using this for a more complicated application, as there should be more seperation into different files for different logic.

##How to use
Assuming you already have an OpenShift account
1) Create a Node.JS application and add a mongo cartridge

	rhc app create <your app name> nodejs-0.6 mongodb-2

2) cd into the directory that matches your application name
	
	cd <your app name>
	
3) add this git repository as an upstream to your application
	
	git remote add upstream -m master git://github.com/openshift/simple_node_express_mongo.git

4) merge this repository into your application

	git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master
	
5) Modify the code and push back up to your OpenShift application

	git push
	

The MongoDB code you want to modify can be found in this line

	self.db.collection('names').find().toArray(function(err, names) {}
	
If you chose to use a different database other than the one named the same as your application you need to change the Auth section as well. 

OpenShift has authentication turned on for the database, therefore any connection has to authenticate. By default a connection from the MongoDB driver will try to authenticate against users in the DB you specify.

Please change the Auth line to look like the following so that the authentication uses the OpenShift provided credentials.

	self.db.authenticate(self.dbUser, self.dbPass, {authdb: "admin"}, function(err, res){...
